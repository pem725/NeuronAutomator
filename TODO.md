# Neuron Newsletter Automation - Development TODO & History

## Project Overview

**Neuron Newsletter Automation** is a cross-platform system that automatically opens the Neuron Daily newsletter with all article links in browser tabs every weekday morning. The system evolved from a simple single-run automation to a sophisticated multi-run system with smart content detection and regular Chrome browser integration.
